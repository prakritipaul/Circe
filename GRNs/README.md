README
-Subdirectories consist of the 50 GRNs built for precursor cell states and terminal cell types by GRNBoost2 [1].

        inference of gene regulatory networks." Bioinformatics 35.12 (2019): 2159-2161

-This directory also consists of inputs to GRNBoost2 (cocktail khids and GRN_df).
-These inputs were generated from the respective "cocktail_pipeline.Rmd" files.

Note on Nomenclature:
"BTN" refers to GRNs made at its precursor state.
"terminal_BTN" refers to GRNs made at its terminal state.
This is true for all cell types.
